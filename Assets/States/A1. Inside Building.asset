  storyText: 'You are in the middle of a huge zombie attack that just sieged your
    city. You are the only surviving person as far as you can see. However, you have
    access to the radio and can hear that there is a signal coming from another city
    just 5 KM away. In these signals, you can understand that there are other survivors
    just like you and they broadcast messages for other survivors.You have to break
    the invasion and safely reach to other humans.

    Meanwhile you are trapped in your building without any light, and you only have
    a limited supply of food. You have to act quick. You are just looking outside
    the window, and you can see a few zombies patrolling.You have to create a strategy.


    What will you do?


    1) Throw a few objects you gathered to the zombies from the window.


    2) Throw few objects you gathered far away to take their attention away so you
    can escape from the front door.'
